Instructions on how to approach this exercise:

  -  Please attach a readme file on how to run the program
  -  If there is anything that is not covered as part of the requirement, please make your own decision on how it should be handled
  -  If you do make assumptions, please detail why you made them in the readme file
  -  Please send us the source code via a Google Drive link
  -  Include the pom.xml file containing any dependencies you might use for easy set-up on our side
  -  Both the tests and implementation code will be assessed


The assessment will be done based upon:

  - How well the code is tested
  - The design choices made when implementing the solution (design patterns, maintainability etc.)
  - Exception and special case handling


Requirements:

  - Use Spring for Dependency Injection
  - Use the Command Design Pattern for the commands 
  - Use JPA for persistence and H2 as the underlying database to persist command history



*** The Problem ***


__Description__

You're given the task of writing a simple console version of a drawing program. 
At this time, the functionality of the program is quite limited but this might change in the future. 
In a nutshell, the program should work as follows:
 1. Create a new canvas
 2. Start drawing on the canvas by issuing various commands
 3. Be able to undo the last command
 4. Be able to redo the last undo command
 3. Quit


Command 		Description
C w h           Should create a new canvas of width w and height h.
L x1 y1 x2 y2   Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only
                horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines
                will be drawn using the 'x' character.
R x1 y1 x2 y2   Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and
                lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn
                using the 'x' character.
Z               Should undo the last command.
X               Should redo the last undo command.
H               To Display this Help.
Q               Should quit the program.

__Sample I/O__
